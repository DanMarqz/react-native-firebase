# react-native-firebase

This is a CRUD in React Native made with Javascript and React. 

This is a project based on a online course, focused on learning about how this tool works. 

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

npm
```npm
npm install
```
or  
yarn
```yarn
yarn install
```

# Usage

To run the project: 

```npm
expo start
```
